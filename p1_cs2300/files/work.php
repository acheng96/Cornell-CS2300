					  <p>During the summer of 2015, I interned at a small tech and cosmetics startup called Melange as an iOS developer. Over the course of 8-weeks, I created their app from the initial design to beta testing to the official App Store release. The completed app uses computer vision and machine learning technology to provide custom makeup to users. </p>

					  <p>During the summer of 2015, aside from my Melange internship,  I worked remotely for a startup called Comblie during my free time. Comblie is a mobile app that combines several social networks into one unified news, messages, profiles, and activities feed. As the tech lead, I recruited a distributed team of three developers to build the first iOS app prototype and the landing page. </p>
